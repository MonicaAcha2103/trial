<h1>Exercise 5</h1>
<script src="task4.js"></script>

<!--
This exercise calls for you to write some async flow-control code to more properly handle
the provided callback mess as shown in "task4.js".

Request all 3 files at the same time (in "parallel").
Render them ASAP (don't just blindly wait for all to finish loading)
BUT, render them in proper (obvious) order: "file1", "file2", "file3".
After all 3 are done, output "Complete!".
Use either native promises, the asynquence lib (provided), or your own favorite async/promises library/utility.
